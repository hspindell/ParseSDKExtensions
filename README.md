This library provides utilities, extensions and best practices when interacting with a [Parse Server](https://parseplatform.org/) or a the derivative [Hyperdrive Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modernistik/hyperdrive). When buildling applications that interact with Hyperdrive or [Parse Server](https://parseplatform.org/), you can include this library in order to get the additional [Parse SDK](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX) extensions as well as the Hyperdrive protocol, which should serve as a foundation for buildling a Parse-Server-connected mobile application.
